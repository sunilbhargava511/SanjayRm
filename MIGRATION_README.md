# Financial Advisor: STT/TTS to ElevenLabs Conversational AI Migration

This document outlines the complete migration from custom Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) implementation to ElevenLabs Conversational AI for natural voice interactions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation flow without manual controls
- ‚úÖ Better voice quality and reduced latency
- ‚úÖ Advanced interruption handling and conversation management
- ‚úÖ Powerful webhook integration for real-time financial data
